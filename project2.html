            This project was completed for the Foundations of Software Engineering course at CSUF.
            I, along with two classmates, came together to create a running app that would track and map the user's
            runs.
            Users would be able to save these runs to their phones to revisit later. We also added a screenshot sharing
            feature to allow users to share their runs.

            The app was built for Apple devices using Xcode and the Swift programming language.
            This was a semester-long project, and we faced a lot of challenges.

            The first challenge was having access to the right tools.
            Personally, I did not own a MacBook, which is required to use Xcode and Swift.
            I had to look into on-campus resources to obtain a MacBook for the semester.
            Thankfully, the library had a loaner program, and I was able to borrow one.

            Another challenge was learning how to code in Swift.
            None of us had prior experience with Swift, so we had to rely heavily on online tutorials, documentation,
            and a lot of Googling.
            Fortunately, there were plenty of helpful resources available to guide us through the development process.
