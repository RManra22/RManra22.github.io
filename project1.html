            As mentioned before, this project started out as an exam from a course.
            It was written in C++ and was meant to teach us how to use classes and structures.
            It also introduced us to object-oriented programming, which is commonly used in the industry.
            One of the main challenges I faced while working on this assignment was the actual display of the table.
            Like all periodic tables, there is a break in the elements to allow it to fit on one page, and our professor
            wanted us to represent this in our program.
            I struggled with this a lot and was unable to figure it out before the assignment's due date.
            A few weeks after the deadline, I decided to return to the project and try again.
            I was eventually able to get it working, and then I thought it would be cool to add the ability to modify
            the element information.
            So I took some time and added the functionality to do so.
            This allowed me to learn more about reading from and writing to text files.
            Overall, this project was quite fun to work on, and it taught me the important lesson of taking breaks while
            coding.
