# Personal Portfolio Website

This website was created as the final project for my Web Front-end Engineering course.  
The goal of the project was to build a personal portfolio that introduces who I am, highlights my skills, and showcases some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on.

The site includes several pages: a homepage, about me page, a skills page, a list of projects, and a contact form with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn. I also added features like dark mode and mobile responsiveness to make it more modern and user-friendly.

This project helped me practice structuring multi-page websites, working with responsive layouts, adding animation, and organizing a real portfolio I can continue improving.
