        <p class="center">
            Hello, like I mentioned before, I am a Mexican-American, first-generation college student.
            Currently, I am attending CSUF in pursuit of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
            I plan to graduate from CSUF in the Spring of 2026, but there is still a chance that this could change.
            I also have my Associate degree in Computer Science from Santa Ana College. I hope to one day
            become a software engineer, or I would be happy with any job in tech. I fell in love with the tech world
            during the summer of my senior year. I had friends who were already coding, and by being around them,
            I also developed an interest in coding. This interest grew even more as I started watching tech-related videos on YouTube.
            My love for tech even led me to build my own gaming computer so I could play with those same friends.
            Over that summer, I knew that Computer Science was what I wanted to study in college. I even took a coding class in high
            school in hopes of preparing myself for college. Sadly, when it came time for college acceptances, I was not accepted
            into any of the Computer Science programs I applied to. Because of this, I decided to attend Santa Ana College in hopes
            of transferring to a four-year university after a few years. That is exactly what I did, and it has been the best decision
            I have made. Community college truly was the way to go since it was practically free and allowed me to get all the
            classes I considered boring out of the way. It was very tough at first because I worried a lot about the transfer process
            and how I would perform once at a four-year university. Thankfully, I feel that Santa Ana College fully prepared me to
            succeed at CSUF, and that is what I have been doing â€” and hope to continue to do.
