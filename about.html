        <p class="center">
            Hello like I mentioned before I am a Mexican-American first generation college student. 
            Currently I am attending CSUF in persuit of a my Bachelors degree in Computer Science. 
            I plan to graduate from CSUF in the Spring of 2026 but there is still a chance that it will change. 
            I also have my Associate degree in Computer Science from Santa Ana College. I hope to one day
            be a software engineer or I would really be happy with any job in tech. I fell in love with the whole tech world 
            during the summer of my Senior year. I had friends who were already doing coding and by being near them 
            I also took an intrest for coding. This was later increased by watching tech related videos on YouTube.  
            My love for tech has gone as far as to make me build my own gaming computer to be albe to play with those same friends. 
            Over that summer I knew that Computer Science was what I was going to study in college. I even took a coding class in high
            school in hopes of preparing myself for college. Sadly when it came around to acceptance for colleges, I was not accepted 
            to any of the colleges I applied for their computer science program. With this I decided to attend Santa Ana College in hopes 
            to transfer to a four year university after a few years at a community college. That is exactly what I did and it has been best thing 
            that I have done. Community college really was the way to go since it was practally free and it allowed me to get all the classes 
            that I considered boring out of the way. It was very tough at first since I worried alot about the whole transfering process 
            and how I would preform once at a four year university. Thanfully I feel like I was fully prepared by Santa Ana college to 
            succsed at CSUF and it is what I have been doing and hope to continue to do so.
